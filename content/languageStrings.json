I hope they feel better soon. \n     \n\n    Me too! \n     \n\n    Then right through here is the last room I would like to show you. This is a monitoring \n    slash control room.

It's fantastic. \n     \n\n\n    Doctor Rivera. You're needed in the upper deck board room. Pleae report as soon \n    as possible. \n     \n\n    Oh looks like I'm needed.
