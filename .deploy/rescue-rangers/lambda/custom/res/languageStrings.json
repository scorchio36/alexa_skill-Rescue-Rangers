            "GiraffeInfo.narration": "Giraffes are native to Africa and are known for being the tallest mammals on Earth. They can grow up to 18 feet tall. That is as tall as a two story house! <break time=\"0.5s\" /> \n  \n    Giraffes are very strange animals because they spend most of their lives standing up. They eat standing up. They give birth standing up. They even sleep standing up! These creatures are vegetarians. That means they do not eat meat. Giraffes usually like to pick their food from the top of trees and bushes using their long necks. <break time=\"0.5s\" />\n  \n    Giraffes are covered in spots. No two of these spot patterns are alike. It is like how every human has a unique fingerprint. End of description. <break time=\"1s\" />",
            "PandaInfo.narration": "The Giant Panda bear is an animal native to China and they have lived in China for thousands of years. They are the only bear species known to survive only on a vegetarian diet. They love to eat bamboo. It is their favorite food. They love it so much that they can eat 40 pounds of bamboo a day. I wish I could eat 40 pounds of tacos! <break time=\"0.5s\" />\n    \n    Adult pandas weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. Mothers are 900 times bigger than their cubs when the cubs are born. Because cubs are so tiny, they can be tricky to keep track of sometimes. <break time=\"0.5s\" />\n    \n    Many panda habitats, <break time=\"0.2s\" /> where the animals live, have been destroyed by human activity. This has resulted in a drop of the number of pandas still living on Earth. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    End of description.",
            "KoiFishInfo.narration": "Koi Fish are descendants of Carp Fish that were raised in Chinese rice fields during the Jin Dynasty, 1700 years ago. In the early 19th century, these Carp fish began being bred for variations in color. They eventually became what we know today as the Koi fish. Koi Fish have beautiful colors and can have colorful spots and patterns. These pretty fish can have white, black, red, cream, yellow, blue, and orange. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    Some Koi fish can grow up to be 3 feet long. They are omnivores. That means that they will eat meat and eat plants. They will eat insects, other fish, peas, lettuce, and even watermelon. A lot of owners will feed Koi Fish food that floats so that the fish will come to the surface and show off their pretty color patterns. Because Koi Fish are smart. they also learn to recognize their owners when they come up and look above the water during feeding time. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    Koi Fish typically live an average of 50 years. However, some Koi Fish have lived over 200 years! A Koi Fish in Japan, named Hanako, lived to be 226 years old. That's definitely older than Grandma. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    End of Description. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>",
            "LionInfo.narration": "Lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa and stand tall as the second largest cat in the entire world. They are very social animals that live together in packs called prides. Male lions can be as long as 7 feet and, on average, weigh 400 pounds. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    The male lion flaunts a beautiful mane and is generally what most people think about when they think about the fear-giving power of a lion. But it is actually the mane-less female lions that do most of the hunting in a pride. The females use well thought-out tactics to capture the necessary 11 pounds of meat that they each need a day, and the 15 pounds of meat each male lion needs per day. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    Lions are blazing fast. In small lengths, they can reach up to 50 miles per hour. I wish I could run that fast. If that isn't scary enough, their powerful roars can be heard from 5 miles away. \n    \n    <break time=\"0.5s\"/>Despite their menacing stature, lions spend most of their day sleeping. They generally sleep and laze around for 16 to 20 hours. Sounds like me on a weekend. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>\n    \n    End of Description. <break time=\"0.5s\"/>",

That's the Treehouse! \n    Let's get over there so I can show you around! \n     \n\n    Did you know that there are over 10 million species of animals, plants, and \n    insects known to man? Over half of them lives in this rain forest. That's crazy! \n\n     \n    Welp, here we are! \n\n    You didn't think it was an actual treehouse did you.

I would love to show you guys around!  \n    Dr. Da Silva, please cover for me while I show these Rangers around. \n     \n\n     \n    Come on Rangers. Let's go through here first. \n     \n\n     \n    This here is the laboratory.  \n     \n\n     \n\n    Wow! So many different animals! Are any of them sick? \n     \n\n    Thankfully no. These are animals that have been sick here before. We have been keeping \n    an eye on them. We are doing follow up tests to make sure that they are living \n    normal, healthy lives. We want to learn from them so we can help animals even faster \n    and better than we already do. \n     \n\n    That's so great. \n\n     \n\n    Next through here we have the hospital wing. Here is where we hold our sick \n    and hurt animals. \n     \n\n    Oh no! Poor babies! \n     \n    Will they be alright? \n     \n\n    Oh yes! No worries. We will be able to help each and every one of them to get better. \n    We have a large group of medical professionals working to get them patched up. \n     \n\n\n     \n\n    That's great! I hope they feel better soon. \n     \n\n    Me too! \n     \n\n    Then right through here is the last room I would like to show you. This is a monitoring \n    slash control room. The control room allows us to controls camera and special robots \n    that we have placed throughout the Amazon rainforest. These cameras and robots help us quickly \n    find any animals that may be hurt or in danger. \n     \n\n    That's incredible! We can see everything in the rainforest from right here! \n     \n\n    That's right. We have been able to help so many animals because of this monitoring \n    system. It's fantastic. \n     \n\n\n    Doctor Rivera. You're needed in the upper deck board room. Pleae report as soon \n    as possible. \n     \n\n    Oh looks like I'm needed. I will have to cut the tour a little short, but please. \n    You rangers feel right at home and feel free to look around.
